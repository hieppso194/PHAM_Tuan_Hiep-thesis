\section{CONCLUSION}

Remind that the objective of my work is to identify the factor that has big impact on query performance and to show its effect by benchmarking it with JOB benchmark. 

Through my thesis, I studied new technologies, the architecture of PostgreSQL as well as the way to benchmark a parameter in DBMS. I summarize the obtained results:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Studying techniques, technologies such as: PostgreSQL and 			well-known bencmarks such as: TPC benchmarks, JOB benchmark.
	\item Studying the theory about the query optimization, the 				structure of benchmarks and implementing those.
	\item Consolidation of C programming, Python programming, Bash 				Script programming, SQL database.
\end{itemize} 

\section{FUTURE WORK}

In short term, I will extend the showing of cardinality estimation's effect by creating an extension of PostgreSQL. This extension will make a comparision between PostgreSQL with default cardinality estimation, with true cardinality and with some published solutions. 

In long term, I will research solutions that were published and then create a new solution to reduce the effect of bad cardinality estimation to query performance.
