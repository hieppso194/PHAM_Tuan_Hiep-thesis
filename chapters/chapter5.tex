\section{CONCLUSION}
{\justify
Remind that the objective of my work is to find the main factor that effect the most to query performance and to prove its effect by benchmarking it with JOB benchmark.

{\justify
Through my thesis, I gain new technologies, the architecture of PostgreSQL as well as the way to benchmark a parameter in DBMS. I summarize the obtained results:
\begin{itemize}
\item Studying techniques, technologies such as: PostgreSQL and well-known bencmarks such as: TPC benchmarks, JOB benchmark.
\item Studying the theory about the query optimization, the structure of benchmarks and implementation those.
\item Consolidation of C programming, Python programming, Bash Script programming, SQL database.
\end{itemize}

\section{FUTURE WORK}
{\justify
In short term, I will extend the proving of cardinality estimation's effect by creating an extension of PostgreSQL. This extension will make a comparision between PostgreSQL with default cardinality estimation, with true cardinality and with some published solutions.

{\justify
In long term, I will research more solution that were publish and then create a new solution to reduce the negatively effect of cardinality estimation to query performance.
